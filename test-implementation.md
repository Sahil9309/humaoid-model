# Implementation Test Plan

## Changes Made

### A) Layout Changes ✓
1. **Split Sidebar Layout**: Changed from single sidebar to dual side-by-side panels:
   - Left Panel (w-80): FileUploadPanel 
   - Right Panel (w-80): VideoRecorder
   - Maintained responsive design and backdrop styling

2. **FileUploadPanel Updated**: Removed hardcoded width, now properly fits within container

### B) Video Feed Control ✓
1. **Live Camera Hide/Show Logic**: 
   - MediaPipeTracker now shows only when `!isPlayingRecordedVideo`
   - Properly hides live camera feed during recorded video playback

2. **Recorded Video Position**: 
   - Shows in same position as live camera (top-right area)
   - Only displays when `recordedVideoBlob && isPlayingRecordedVideo`
   - Positioned "below" live camera feed conceptually (replaces it during playback)

3. **Automatic Re-enable**: 
   - Live camera automatically re-appears when recorded video ends
   - Managed through `isPlayingRecordedVideo` state

### C) Robot Movement Synchronization ✓ (Preserved)
1. **Recording**: Joint states captured at 30 FPS during recording
2. **Playback**: Joint states played back at 30 FPS, synchronized with video
3. **Robot Updates**: useEffect properly applies joint states to URDF model

## Testing Checklist

### Layout Testing
- [ ] Two side-by-side panels visible (file upload left, video recording right)  
- [ ] Each panel has proper width and styling
- [ ] Main 3D canvas area properly sized between panels
- [ ] Responsive design maintained

### Video Feed Control Testing
- [ ] Live camera visible by default
- [ ] "Start Recording" button works
- [ ] "Stop Recording" button works  
- [ ] "Play Recorded Video" button appears after recording
- [ ] Live camera disappears when recorded video plays
- [ ] Recorded video appears in same position as live camera
- [ ] Live camera reappears when recorded video ends

### Robot Movement Testing
- [ ] Robot joints move with live camera body tracking
- [ ] Robot movements are recorded during video recording
- [ ] Robot accurately replicates recorded movements during video playback
- [ ] Robot returns to live control after recorded video ends

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified:
1. `/client/src/pages/UrdfUploader.jsx`: 
   - Layout: Split single sidebar into dual sidebars
   - Video Control: Added conditional rendering for MediaPipeTracker and recorded video

2. `/client/src/components/FileUploadPanel.jsx`:
   - Removed hardcoded width styling to fit new container layout

### Key Logic Changes:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   ```jsx
   {/* File Upload Panel - Left Sidebar */}
   <div className="w-80 bg-slate-900/80...">
     <FileUploadPanel ... />
   </div>
   
   {/* Video Recording Panel - Right Sidebar */}
   <div className="w-80 bg-slate-900/80...">
     <VideoRecorder ... />
   </div>
   ```

2. **Video Feed Control**:
   ```jsx
   {/* Live camera - hidden during playback */}
   {!isPlayingRecordedVideo && (
     <MediaPipeTracker ... />
   )}
   
   {/* Recorded video - shows during playback */}
   {recordedVideoBlob && isPlayingRecordedVideo && (
     <video ref={recordedVideoPlayerRef} ... />
   )}
   ```

All robot movement synchronization logic was preserved and remains functional.
