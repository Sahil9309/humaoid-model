# Implementation Test Plan

## Changes Made

### A) Two-Column Layout Restructure ✓
1. **Responsive Two-Column Grid**: Changed from flex sidebar layout to CSS Grid:
   - Left Column (50% width): FileUploadPanel + VideoRecorder stacked vertically
   - Right Column (50% width): 3D Robot Model + Camera Feed in upper right corner
   - Added responsive breakpoints: stacks to single column on mobile (lg:grid-cols-2)

2. **Control Panel Consolidation**: Combined both control panels in left column with gap-6 spacing

### B) Camera Feed Repositioning ✓
1. **Camera Position**: 
   - Camera feed positioned in uppermost right part of right column (absolute top-4 right-4)
   - Changed MediaPipeTracker from fixed positioning to absolute within right column
   - Maintains visibility over 3D model without blocking main view

2. **Video Playback Positioning**: 
   - Recorded video player replaces camera feed in same location during playback
   - Only displays when `recordedVideoBlob && isPlayingRecordedVideo`  
   - Seamless transition between live camera and recorded video

3. **Responsive Behavior**: 
   - Camera feed stays properly positioned across different screen sizes
   - Z-index ensures camera overlay doesn't interfere with controls

### C) Robot Movement Synchronization ✓ (Preserved)
1. **Recording**: Joint states captured at 30 FPS during recording
2. **Playback**: Joint states played back at 30 FPS, synchronized with video
3. **Robot Updates**: useEffect properly applies joint states to URDF model

## Testing Checklist

### Layout Testing
- [ ] Left column shows both file upload and video recording panels stacked
- [ ] Right column shows 3D robot model taking full right half of screen  
- [ ] Camera feed positioned in uppermost right corner of right column
- [ ] Responsive design: single column on mobile, two columns on large screens

### Video Feed Control Testing
- [ ] Live camera visible by default
- [ ] "Start Recording" button works
- [ ] "Stop Recording" button works  
- [ ] "Play Recorded Video" button appears after recording
- [ ] Live camera disappears when recorded video plays
- [ ] Recorded video appears in same position as live camera
- [ ] Live camera reappears when recorded video ends

### Robot Movement Testing
- [ ] Robot joints move with live camera body tracking
- [ ] Robot movements are recorded during video recording
- [ ] Robot accurately replicates recorded movements during video playback
- [ ] Robot returns to live control after recorded video ends

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified:
1. `/client/src/pages/UrdfUploader.jsx`: 
   - Layout: Split single sidebar into dual sidebars
   - Video Control: Added conditional rendering for MediaPipeTracker and recorded video

2. `/client/src/components/FileUploadPanel.jsx`:
   - Removed hardcoded width styling to fit new container layout

### Key Logic Changes:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   ```jsx
   {/* Left Column - Controls */}
   <div className="bg-slate-900/80 ... flex flex-col gap-6">
     <FileUploadPanel ... />
     <VideoRecorder ... />
   </div>
   
   {/* Right Column - 3D Model and Camera */}
   <div className="relative flex flex-col">
     <BodyController ... />
     {/* Camera positioned absolutely in upper right */}
     <div className="absolute top-4 right-4 z-30">
       <MediaPipeTracker ... />
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Video Feed Control**:
   ```jsx
   {/* Live camera - hidden during playback */}
   {!isPlayingRecordedVideo && (
     <MediaPipeTracker ... />
   )}
   
   {/* Recorded video - shows during playback */}
   {recordedVideoBlob && isPlayingRecordedVideo && (
     <video ref={recordedVideoPlayerRef} ... />
   )}
   ```

All robot movement synchronization logic was preserved and remains functional.
