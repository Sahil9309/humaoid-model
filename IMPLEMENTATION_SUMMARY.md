# Mobile Camera Feed Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with mobile camera feed integration and switching functionality in the URDF robot controller app.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. MediaPipeTracker Stream Switching
- **Problem**: Component couldn't properly switch between local laptop camera and remote mobile camera via WebRTC
- **Solution**: Enhanced MediaPipeTracker with dynamic stream handling and proper cleanup logic
- **Files**: `/client/src/pages/MediaPipeTracker.jsx`

### 2. Camera Feed Positioning
- **Problem**: Camera feeds remained in fixed positions regardless of active source
- **Solution**: Added `isPrimary` prop for dynamic positioning - primary feed in top-right, secondary (if any) in bottom-right
- **Files**: `/client/src/pages/MediaPipeTracker.jsx`, `/client/src/pages/UrdfUploader.jsx`

### 3. Stream Cleanup & Initialization
- **Problem**: Poor cleanup when switching sources caused memory leaks and initialization failures
- **Solution**: Implemented proper stream cleanup with debounced reinitialization
- **Files**: `/client/src/pages/MediaPipeTracker.jsx`, `/client/src/pages/UrdfUploader.jsx`

## Implementation Details

### MediaPipeTracker Enhancements
- Added props: `isPrimary`, `onStreamReady`
- Dynamic CSS classes based on primary/secondary status
- Proper remote stream frame processing with requestAnimationFrame
- Enhanced cleanup logic in stream change effect
- Stream type detection and display (`currentStreamType` state)

### UrdfUploader Improvements  
- Enhanced camera source switching with proper state reset
- Improved UI for camera source selection
- Added status indicators showing active camera type
- Proper cleanup before source switches

### DesktopWebRTCReceiver Updates
- Added `hideVideo` prop to hide internal preview when stream is consumed elsewhere
- Better status indicators and error handling
- Cleaner integration with MediaPipeTracker

## Key Features

### Seamless Camera Switching
- Switch between laptop and mobile cameras without losing robot control
- Automatic cleanup of resources when switching sources
- Debounced switching to prevent rapid toggling issues

### Dynamic Positioning
- Active camera feed appears larger in top-right corner
- Inactive/secondary feeds (when applicable) appear smaller in bottom-right
- Clear visual indicators showing which camera is active

### Better Resource Management
- Proper MediaPipe instance cleanup
- Stream resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Error recovery mechanisms for failed stream switches

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Build succeeds without syntax errors
- [ ] Laptop camera works by default
- [ ] Mobile camera WebRTC connection works  
- [ ] Switching between sources works smoothly
- [ ] Camera feeds swap positions when switching
- [ ] Robot control continues during camera switches
- [ ] No memory leaks when rapidly switching sources
- [ ] Error handling works for failed connections

## Technical Notes
- Uses debounced effects (200ms) to prevent rapid switching issues
- Remote stream processing uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth playback
- Temporary page reload fallback for complex local camera reinitialization (can be improved)
- Stream type detection ensures proper MediaPipe processing

## Future Improvements
- Remove page reload fallback with better local camera reinitialization
- Add visual transitions between camera switches
- Implement camera quality settings
- Add connection status indicators
- Optimize MediaPipe performance for different stream types
